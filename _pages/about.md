## Research Focus
My current research focuses on eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, leveraging fundamental concepts of statistics, such a functional ANOVA, and game-theoretic concepts, such as the Shapley value, to understand and improve machine learning models and tasks. One main application are feature-based explanations, where I'm interested in efficient computations of the Shapley value and its extension to higher-order interactions. Relying on these concepts, I established theoretical similarities, differences, and possible guarantees of feature-based explanations. Beyond feature-based explanations, I am interested in exploring novel applications of Shapley values and interactions to understand and improve other areas in machine learning, such as LLM prompt compositions or hyperparameter optimization.

I am an active developer of the [shapiq](https://shapiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), which extends the popular [shap](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to any-order feature interactions. [shapiq](https://shapiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) additionally separates the game-theoretic concepts and computations from the application on feature-based explanations, which allows to apply Shapley values and interactions on other machine learning applications.

Another area of my research are explanations in rapidly changing dynamic environments, such as data streams, where I co-organized the [TempXAI: Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams Tutorial-Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/tempxai-workshop/home) tutorial-workshop at ECML PKDD 2024 and the [DynXAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence
from Static to Dynamic](https://sites.google.com/view/dynxai-ecmlpkdd-2023) workshop at ECML PKDD 2023.

I am funded by the interdisciplinary collaborative research centre [TRR 318 Constructing Explainability](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/en/).
