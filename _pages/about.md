## Research Focus
My research focuses on eXplainable AI (XAI) and I am passionate about making machine learning models more transparent and trustworthy. I believe that by leveraging mathematical concepts like the [Shapley value](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html) or [functional ANOVA](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/120876782), we can make model decisions more understandable to users. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and practical, interpretable solutions.

Beyond feature-based explanations, I am exploring novel [applications of Shapley value](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0778) and interactions to enhance other areas in machine learning, such as large language model (LLM) prompt composition and hyperparameter optimization.

I actively contribute to the development of [`shapiq`](https://shapiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), which extends the popular [`shap`](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to support any-order feature interactions. [`shapiq`](https://shapiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) decouples game-theoretic concepts from feature-based applications, enabling the application of Shapley values and interactions across various machine learning tasks.

Another area of my research are explanations in dynamic environments with distribution shifts and rapidly changing models, which appear for instance in evolving data streams. Here, I co-organized the [TempXAI: Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams Tutorial-Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/tempxai-workshop/home) tutorial-workshop at ECML PKDD 2024 and the [DynXAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence
from Static to Dynamic](https://sites.google.com/view/dynxai-ecmlpkdd-2023) workshop at ECML PKDD 2023.

I am funded by the interdisciplinary collaborative research centre [TRR 318 Constructing Explainability](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/en/).
