Hi! I am Fabian Fumagalli and PhD student in Machine Learning group at Bielefeld University.

# Research Focus
My current research focuses on eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, leveraging fundamental concepts of statistics, such a functional ANOVA, and game-theoretic concepts, such as the Shapley value. One main application are feature-based explanations, where my research focused on efficient computations of the Shapley value and its extension to higher-order interactions, Shapley interacitons. I am further interested in the computational challenges of these mathematical concepts, and the theoretical similarities, differences, and possible guarantees of feature-based explanations. Beyond feature-based explanations, I am interested in exploring novel applications of Shapley values and interactions to understand improve areas in machine learning, such as LLM promopt compisition or hyperparameter optimization.

I am an active developer of the [`shapiq`](https://shapiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), which extends the popular `shap`package with any-order feature interactions. `shapiq` additionally separates the game-theoretic concepts and computations from the application on feature-based explanations, which allows to apply Shapley values and interactions on other machine learning applications, finding optimal LLM prompt composition or understanding hyperparameter optimization.

In previous work, I focused also on efficient computation of explanations in rapidly changing dynamic enviornments, such as data streams.

I am part of the interdisciplinary collaborative research centre [TRR 318 Constructing Explainability](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/en/)
